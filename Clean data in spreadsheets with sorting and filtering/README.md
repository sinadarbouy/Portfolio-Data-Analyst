# Clean data in spreadsheets with sorting and filtering

### Scenario:
imagine you are a data analyst working for the superintendent of a large public school district in Portugal. The superintendent wants to know what factors affect student grades in core subjects and what changes can be made to improve student performance. Your team is going to analyze performance data on high school student achievement in two Portuguese public schools, Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS). The data was collected by the school district by means of academic reports and student surveys. The data includes information such as:

- Student grades
- Student background information 
- Student study time
- Student participation in extracurricular activities

## 1. Sorting data
Sort data by school and age
**find error:** any age older than 18 may indicate that a mistake was made when entering that student's age(should speak to superintendent)

## 2. Removing incorrect data
The superintendent tells us that the maximum age limit for which public education is provided is 19 years old and that the age range should be 15-19 for both schools. Any student outside this age range should be deleted from the dataset. 

## 3. Filling in missing data
Find blank cells (Fill all blank cells with the value **none_given**)

## 4. Convert data
convert the data in the Medu and Fedu columns to number format.
